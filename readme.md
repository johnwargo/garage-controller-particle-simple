# Garage Controller Particle Simple

This repository contains the Arduino sketch for a simple garage door opener based on the [Particle Photon](https://store.particle.io/products/photon-2) platform. I built this years ago when I first discovered the Particle Platform and a version of this software has been running on a Particle device in my garage ever since.
